As we’ve said in the class efficiency is a pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay, give an explanation of what that term “efficiency” means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance. Your essay should address the following questions:

-   What is the definition of “efficiency”?

-   What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science?

-   What does efficiency allow you to do?

-   Why is efficiency important?

-   Where did you encounter efficiency, and what were some [“a-ha” moments](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aha%20moment) you had about efficiency? (For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the portfolio.)

Efficiency in technology, as defined by IGI Global, refers to “the effectiveness with which a given set of inputs is used to produce an output.” More specifically, it’s about achieving the greatest possible output with the least amount of input—an optimization of time, effort, computational resources, and even mental overhead. To me, efficiency means meeting or exceeding expectations while minimizing unnecessary complexity, resource usage, and manual intervention, ultimately creating solutions that are both powerful and elegant.

In statistical computing and data science, efficiency goes beyond simply running code faster. It involves extracting accurate insights from data using minimal computational resources, streamlining processes, and crafting code that is both readable and maintainable. Choosing fast algorithms and data structures is one component, but equally important is how data is shaped, stored, and accessed. For example, organizing data into tibbles or other well-structured formats can simplify processing steps, reduce errors, and enhance reproducibility.

Efficiency paves the way for addressing more complex challenges without overwhelming systems or developers. As datasets grow in size and complexity, efficient computing practices ensure that analysis can scale upwards. Robust and scalable code is less likely to break under pressure, leading to more reliable results and more trust in the overall process.

Moreover, efficiency has tangible benefits for resource usage and sustainability. By reducing CPU time, memory consumption, and storage requirements, we are able to cut most operational costs. From a developer’s standpoint, writing more readable and maintainable code translates into improved collaboration: team members can understand and update each other’s work with greater ease, accelerating development cycles and reducing the risk of introducing errors during code revisions.

My personal “a-ha” moments regarding efficiency emerged as I learned practical methods to reduce redundancy and complexity in my codes. Instead of writing the same code blocks repeatedly, I now encapsulate these routines into reusable functions making it more reusable. I have discovered the power of well-chosen iterative techniques, like using vectorization or the purrr package in R to apply transformations across multiple columns or elements simultaneously. In addition, I have also become adept at combining multiple filter conditions into a single, cohesive call—reducing clutter and simplifying logic. Employing across() to mutate multiple columns, or if_any() to condense logical checks, not only saved time but also improved code legibility.

Furthermore, I modernized my approach by incorporating pipelines allowing me to create cleaner codes. By mapping functions across vectors or using pmap() for multi-argument transformations, I reduced repetition and handling of many data. These techniques not only sped up processing but also improved my confidence in the correctness of the results. The journey toward more efficient code taught me that small, incremental improvements can yield substantial rewards: shorter run times, reduced computational costs, and more seamless collaboration with others.
