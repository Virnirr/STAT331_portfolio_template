***Describe how you have improved as a practitioner and student of data science this quarter through your work in the course.***

-   Focus specifically on data science concepts and the skills we employed in learning them, not a laundry list of topics that you learned (those are in the syllabus, so I know them already).

-   Focus on a small number of specific areas of growth for you that happened in STAT 331. Identify at least one artifact in your portfolio that illustrates each area of growth and explain how this artifact shows growth in the way you are describing.

**Essay**:

My experience as a data science practitioner and student this quarter has been invaluable in helping me develop industry-relevant skills I had not previously encountered. I would like to highlight three specific areas of personal and professional growth: creating professional-quality reports with Quarto, conducting thorough data exploration and analysis, and improving my collaboration and patience in team settings. These three facets were central to my development throughout the quarter.

When I started this class, I did not expect to learn how to build professional-looking portfolios. However, this course showed me the importance of presenting my work in a clear and polished manner—something crucial for any potential clients or stakeholders. While technical proficiency is essential, I realized that effective communication of goals, methods, and outcomes is equally important. Quarto provided a streamlined way to produce well-formatted documents, helping me eliminate warnings, control code displays, and present results in a more organized, client-friendly format. I have demonstrated this many as all of my Quarto documents now have certain formats that prevent warnings, messages, and does code folds to look more professional.This skill is especially important for a data scientist who must frequently share results with peers, executives, or customers to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

In addition to building professional documentation, my abilities in data exploration and statistical analysis have grown significantly. Although I initially struggled to demonstrate these skills, tools like `dplyr`, `ggplot`, and summary functions improved my data collection and aggregation processes. These tools enabled me to create informative visualizations and delve deeper into my datasets, as exemplified by the unique graph I produced for Lab 7, Question 2. Beyond visualization, I also learned new statistical analysis techniques—such as conducting t-tests (Lab 1) and ANOVAs (Lab 2)—that reinforced my data-driven claims and provided more robust evidence for my conclusions.

Finally, one of the most valuable lessons I learned this quarter was the importance of collaboration and patience. Each week, we partnered with different classmates for practice activities. Although it was challenging at first, I learned how to operate effectively as both a “Developer” and a “Coder,” roles that mirror the collaborative nature of the tech industry. Patience played a key role as I revised my work after receiving “Growth” or “Incomplete” marks on labs and challenges. Iterating on my submissions taught me the value of reflection, adaptability, and continual improvement—essential traits for success in any professional environment.
